# A simple particle engine in WebGL
I created this for a game engine architecture course at MTSU.  It must be executed from a server, to get a basic one running you can use ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer``` from the project root.

This was a study in getting particle effects (flames, fog, etc) to render on a WebGL canvas.  Additionally, there are elements atop the canvas which can be thought of as a rudimentary 'HUD' in a basic video game.
